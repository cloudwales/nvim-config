# Nvim config

This is the nvim config I have setup on my machine that I use for writing Laravel apps, Rust apps and everything inbetween. 

This is a work in progress and will change, but can be used by anyone as a starting point. 

### Notes

For php Laravel projects using inteliphense, you need to add a file to the project.
